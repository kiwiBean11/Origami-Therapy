  <p>Koi fish are symbols of perseverance, strength andtransformation in Japanese and Chinese cultures.
  One famous legend is Dragon Gate, a Chinese legend. It describes a group of golden koi fish swiming up the Yellow River,
  fighitng strong currents and predators along the way. Once they reach the Dragon Gate, a large waterfall, a large number
  of the koi get discouraged and head back downriver. The remaining koi try for 100 years to get past the waterfall, until
  finally one of them successfully jumps over. The gods transform the fish into a golden dragon to recognize its
  perseverance, courage, and determination</p>
