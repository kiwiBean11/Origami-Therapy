  <h1>Origami Crane</h1>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux1ECrNDZl4" target="_blank">Make a paper crane!</a>
  <p>Paper cranes are considered a symbol of good fortune and luck. There is a legend that if you fold 1000 paper cranes you get a wish.
    If you fold all of these cranes within one year then any one wish you have will be granted.
  This legend became popular after a young girl named Sadako Sasaki attempted to make 1000 paper cranes to wish for health after
  being exposed to radiation from the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima. Unforutnately, she only made around 644 cranes, and her classmates
  made the remaining cranes to bury with her.</p>
